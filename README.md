SAC prep

Eggerfecto was an exercise in prepeartion for a SAC. This was done  before the last SAC for the year to demonstrate what we have learnt. Eggerfecto was an exercise to read client requirements and build applications based on given requirements. As the requirements were a simple prototype application that will record a receipt for a customer ordering Chocolate eggs.
